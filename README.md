# Yasarna Quran Reader App

The Yasarna Quran Reader app is an open-source Android application that aims to help users learn how to read the Quran using the book "Yasarna." The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to tap on words or sentences within the book's pages and hear the pronunciation of the selected content.

## Features

- Tap-to-pronounce: Users can tap on any word or sentence in the pages of the "Yasarna" book, and the app will play the corresponding audio pronunciation.

- User-submitted audios: The app allows users to upload their versions of audio pronunciations. Once uploaded, the submissions will be reviewed and approved by the app's maintainers.

- Community-driven audio selection: Approved user-submitted audios will become available as choices for users to select from in the app. This way, the app's audio library will grow with valuable contributions from the community.

- Rating system: Users can rate the audios they listen to, helping others identify the most accurate and high-quality pronunciations.
