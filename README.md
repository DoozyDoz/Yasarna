# Yasarna Qur'an Pronunciation App

The Yasarna Qur'an Pronunciation App is a community-driven project aimed at providing a convenient and interactive way to learn the pronunciation of the Qur'an. This project is open-source, so anyone is welcome to contribute to its development.

## Features

- **Interactive Pronunciation Guide**: The app contains all 66 pages of the Yasarna book. Users can tap on a word or sentence to hear its pronunciation.

- **Community Contributions**: The app allows users to upload their own versions of pronunciations for approval. Once approved, these pronunciations become available for other users to choose from.

- **Rating System**: Users can rate the available pronunciations. This allows the community to highlight the most helpful and accurate pronunciations.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated! You can contribute in several ways:

1. **Code**: If you're a developer, feel free to work on any open issues or create a pull request with your proposed changes.

2. **Audio**: If you're proficient in Qur'an recitation, you can help by uploading your own pronunciation versions. Please remember to follow the app's guidelines for audio submissions.

3. **Ratings**: By rating the existing audio files, you can help the community identify the best pronunciations.
